  <h2>Golang DSL</h2>
  <p>Golang is not meant to be DSL friendly language like Haskell. It is still possible to use Golang to implement DSL such as http/Template package which parses the input (template) and fills the template with values from golang langueage. This can be used for example in simple Email templating or even implementing SSI type of html pages. http/Template package implements parser that reads the template and calls the Go language part defined in {{}}.</p>
  <p>DSL can be characterized to Internal and External DSLs languages. Internals extends langauge with approprieate constructs to specialized to problem domain such in QML. Golang does this in the sense that there is channel syntax <- easing communication easier with goroutines. Second category: External DSLs is more interesting as it provides more flexibility in the language and broading the effective problems domains that are not part of original Golang design. Golang features are lacking in this respect manyways. Latest version of Golang present plugins architecture that runs in process making possible at runtime extend functionality by loading libraries and casting interfaces to internally in library.</p>
  <p>There is also possibility interact between components using RPC where different parallel/sub processes are specialized to different tasks. Separate processes can be implemented over system boundary using local or remote sockets and common datatypes. This model is flexible and robuest but doesn't provide low hanging fruits without appropriate framework on top of Golang. One interesting framework implementing this kind of functionality is Hashicorp Golang plugin.</p>
  <p>So far discussion about Golang using everywhere doesn't look very promising. It is good language and very effective in certain networking domain with parallelism and IO streams, not very flexible at the moment with Everything. I personally think that one way to extend language is to utilize plugins. Golan provides quite good interaction with C already. It would be nice to see Similar interaction provided to some DSL specialized language. There are suitable languages for DSL designing like Haskell; with support of RPC and thrift/protobuf provides interoperability with Golang to some external extent. Haskell is generic language that can be used to make DSL but there are also specialized languages such as Xtext and Jetbrains MPS that are designed to make DSLs. Domains in specialized languages can vary as well. There is no single solution fits all purpses. In my opinion one of the best use case for Golang DSL would be specify network components integration language; similar that i've started in txmachinae repository.</p>
  <p>Obvious solution to implement DSL with Golang would be using CGo. Use Go to call C function that calls Haskell function. Result would be C type or socket for communication and streaming. Ducktape ie. Golang/channels|mutexes/Goroutine/CGo/<dsl> would seem like doable taping and natural usage of Golang. </p>
